title: JBoss BPM Suite v6.1 - CI/CD with jenkins
---

CI/CD is a heavily discussed topic in the past few years with each individual or organization having their own patterns and methodology. &nbsp;There is no one single way of implementing CI/CD, it is what fits within your organization. &nbsp;There may be ideal patterns out there that one could leverage.<br /><br />I recently set up an example jenkins CI/CD pipeline involving JBoss BPM Suite. &nbsp;I leveraged the following components:<br /><br /><ul><li>jenkins (docker)</li><li>gogs (docker)</li><li>sonatype nexus oss (docker)</li><li>JBoss BPM Suite v6.1 (docker and non-docker)</li><ul><li>Design</li><li>Development</li><li>Test</li><li>QA</li></ul></ul>The pipeline has the following flow:<br /><br /><ol><li>Initial</li><ol><li>Check out from gogs, the BPM project</li><li>Build the project</li><li>Push to nexus</li></ol><li>Deploy to BPM Development</li><li>Perform a test of the process on BPM Development</li><li>In parallel</li><ol><li>Deploy to BPM Test</li><li>Deploy to BPM QA</li></ol></ol><div>The BPM runtime environments are setup to pull from the central nexus repository if the compiled project is not available locally.</div><div><br /></div><div>At the moment in BPM v6.1 there is no githook to trigger a push to the enterprise gogs git, so it's a manual process. &nbsp;One could also schedule a cron job to push by time or a job that polls for changes. &nbsp;In the future there is a planned function of a githook* so that it will provide a trigger to push to the enterprise git. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The project I am leveraging is based on the <a href="https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/bpms-customer-evaluation-demo">Customer Evaluation</a> demo from JBoss Demo Central.</div><div><br /></div><div>Given that this is an example, I'm performing simple checks on the process to make sure that it is deployed and functioning properly. &nbsp;You can find exports of the jenkins jobs at my <a href="https://github.com/kenthua/bpms-cicd">github repo</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also recorded a video of the project available <a href="https://vimeo.com/139751946">here</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>* As with any mention of future functions and dates, all plans subject to change.</div><br /><br /><br /><br />
