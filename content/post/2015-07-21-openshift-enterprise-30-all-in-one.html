title: 'OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 all in one vagrant build '
---

It's been a while since I last posted, but here is something different. &nbsp;I spent sometime playing with vagrant and for my first attempt it took a while to get used to.<br /><br />However, the result is a working vagrant build which will build out an all in one OSE environment. &nbsp;There is one external dependency which is an external DNS server. &nbsp;I think I will eventually make a change so you can just have it point to an external domain of yours.<br />It works, however, I'm sure there are better ways or efficient ways to make things better. &nbsp;If there are some tips/suggestions please send them my way.<br /><br />Lots of dependencies of course, such as a Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise subscription.<br /><br />So where to get it? &nbsp;Github of course. &nbsp;Link <a href="https://github.com/kenthua/openshift/tree/master/vagrant/aio">here</a>.<br /><br />Do you want to just do everything with the upstream code or you don't have a subscription? &nbsp;The openshift origin team put together a development vagrant build on <a href="https://github.com/openshift/vagrant-openshift">github</a> as well.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE: </b>link to the github repo with the aio has been updated<br /><br /><br />Hope this is helpful!
