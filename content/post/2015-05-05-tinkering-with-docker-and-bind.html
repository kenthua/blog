title: Tinkering With Docker and BIND DNS
---

I've been tinkering with Docker, Kubernetes and all sorts of middleware technology as it relates to Red Hat.  Recently I needed to setup a quick DNS server and I figured why not put it in a docker image.<br /><br />So here is the link via github to the <a href="https://github.com/kenthua/bind-dns-config">repo</a><br /><br />So you can setup your own or within a docker image and run it in a docker container.<br /><br />I leveraged some instructions found <a href="http://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/configure-dns-bind-server-on-centos-7-rhel-7.html#axzz3ZCAxA2oC">here</a> in this post.
